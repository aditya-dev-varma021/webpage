    <h1>Research<br>
        </h1>
        <h2>I am deeply passionate about research, particularly in the humanities, in areas such as international relations history and the evolution of constitutional jurisprudence. 
            <br><br>I was selected to attend the 2020 Johns Hopkins National Undergraduate Humanities Symposium to present my research on the devolution of Indo-American foreign relations from 1947-1971 with an emphasis on the popular perceptions of foreign policy. 
            <br> Find my site on the Macksey Commons <a style="text-decoration: none; color:lightblue;"href="https://www.mackseysymposium.org/virtual2020/all/presentations/240/">here.</a> <br><br>
            My paper is pending publication in the Macksey Humanities Journal and is currently a working paper. Please contact me if you would like a rough copy! I intend to post it here when finished. 
            <br><br>
            I intend on starting new projects concerning the domestic history of the American West and possibly on the political economy of Catalonia or some other microcosmic state. <br><br> 
            I am not as familiar with the world of computational research yet, but am  enthusiastic with regards to pursuing research as I further along in my degree and gain a better understanding of the tools and parameters of the field.
           <br><br> Contact me for more information on any of these endeavors!
